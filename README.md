## Setup local environment

Follow the steps below to take up and running a local environment.

1. (Of course) - Clone this repository;
2. Inside root folder: `composer install`;

## Development patterns
Before publish the website our default branch is setted to `develop`.
While developing make sure that you're following the [Branch naming and Commits conventions](https://outline.fuerzastudio.com/doc/instrucoes-do-git-GNUD47SZUM).
When working with PHP also make sure that you're applying the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/) (whenever possible) and always using [SOLID and CALISTHENICS](https://pt.slideshare.net/guilhermeblanco/php-para-adultos-clean-code-e-object-calisthenics) code.
